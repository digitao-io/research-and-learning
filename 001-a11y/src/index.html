  <h2>1. Headline Hierarchy</h2>

  <p>
    At least if one uses NVDA, he should be able to use 1 to 6 keys to go
    through different headlines. So to keep a well structured headline
    structure is very important.

  <h2>2. Keyboard Accessibility</h2>

  <h3>2.1. Default Tab Focusing Behaviour</h3>

  <p>The interactive elements are usually "tab-able" by default:</p>

  <div>
    <a href="https://example.org/">Just a link</a>
  </div>

  <div>
    <button>And a button</button>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>
      <span>Just a random input: </span>
      <input type="text" placeholder="And a text input">
    </label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>
      <span>Car brands: </span>
      <select name="cars">
        <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
        <option value="saab">Saab</option>
        <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
        <option value="audi">Audi</option>
      </select>
    </label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>
      <input type="radio">
      <span>This is a radio</span>
    </label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox">
      <span>This is a checkbox</span>
    </label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <textarea name="w3review" rows="4" cols="50">And also a text area.</textarea>
  </div>

  <p>
    Most of them can be interacted with pressing spacebar. The only
    exception are links, user has to press enter to interacte with it.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2. Make Something Tab-able and Focusable</h3>

  <p tabindex="0">
    By adding <code>tabindex="0"</code>, we can make everything tab-able and
    focusable. This paragraph is both tab-able and focusable.
  </p>

  <p tabindex="-1">
    By adding <code>tabindex="-1"</code>, we will make an element not tab-able
    but focusable. To focus on an element with tabindex being set to -1, we
    have to use JavaScript.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3. Some Considerations</h3>

  <p>
    Usually, by pressing tab, user want to jump through severl big sections,
    but if user want to navigate through the detailed content, they should
    use arrow keys. The combination of <code>role="menu"</code> and also
    <code>role="menuitem"</code> will make this happen.
  </p>

  <div class="message-list" style="display: flex; border: 1px solid black;">
    <ul
      tabindex="0"
      role="menu"
      aria-label="Message list. Please use arrow up or arrow down to navigate through different messages."
    >
      <li class="message-item" tabindex="-1" role="menuitem">
        First message
      </li>
      <li class="message-item" tabindex="-1" role="menuitem">
        Second message
      </li>
      <li class="message-item" tabindex="-1" role="menuitem">
        Third message
      </li>
    </ul>
    <section style="border-left: 1px solid grey;" tabindex="0" aria-label="Message content.">
      <p>
        This is the content of message. A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy
        dog. Accessibility is very important.
      </p>
    </section>
  </div>

  <p>
    In most of the cases, using the combination of specific tags or roles in
    HTML is already sufficient for challenge of making an accessible web page
    with keyboard. However, they cannot always cover everything in it. That's
    why sometimes we have to write JavaScript to implement the keyboard
    structure. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes, NVDA or other screen reading software will capture the key
    event. Since it is part of their functionality. This will cause our
    JavaScript not able to capture the keyboard event. To prevent this,
    use <code>role="application"</code> to tell NVDA, now we are in charge
    of everything. But if we do this, all the sub elements won't be read
    out by NVDA anymore. To prevent this, we can always add another role
    to the children elements, to make NVDA read it normally.

  <h2>3. Screenreader Accessibility</h2>

  <h3>3.1. Baseline</h3>
  
  <p>
    Generally speaking, if we use the correct HTML tag with semantic meaning,
    combined with correct and necessary roles, the web page will be also
    screenreader accessible.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2. Skip to Main Content</h3>

  <p>
    Most website has been built to put the menubar at the top of the page, it
    is actually logically correct. However, if a screenreader user is using
    this kind of page, he or she must go through all the content until he
    reaches the main content of the page. To overcome this problem, we can
    introduce a link at the beginning of the page, so that the user can
    directly jump to the content by pressing enter.
  </p>

  <p>
    To implement this, simply add an ID to the container of the main content,
    and add an anchor link like <code>href="#main-content"</code> and that's
    it.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3. Dynamic Content and Live-area</h3>
